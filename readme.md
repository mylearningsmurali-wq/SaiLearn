Features and Usage:
Code Suggestions: GitHub Copilot provides real-time code suggestions as you type, completing lines of code, entire functions, and even generating boilerplates based on your context.
Inline Chat: Engage in a conversation with Copilot directly within your IDE to ask coding-specific questions, receive code explanations, generate unit tests, refactor code, and more.
Agent Mode: For more complex tasks, Copilot Agent Mode allows you to assign multi-step coding jobs that Copilot can handle autonomously, modifying multiple files as needed.
Documentation Assistance: Use features like the /doc command in chat to generate comments and documentation for your code.
Prerequisites:
An active GitHub Copilot individual subscription or membership in an organization with a Copilot subscription.
